## Hi there 👋

I'm Anatoly Melnikov. 
I'm almost a dinosaur. 14+ years in development 😏 

For most of this time I was a PHP developer. I'm experiensed in developing of FinTec projects, LMS (learning management systems) and APIs for data synchronization. My latest passion is developing tools to automate code quality control.

According to my superiors and subordinates, I am an excellent team leader 😊
